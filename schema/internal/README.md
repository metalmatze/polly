## Upstream Me: Stuff Pollypkg shouldn't own

These subdirectories contain stuff that doesn't properly belong with Polly itself, but rather with the upstream system that owns it. Anything here is intended to be a temporary local staging ground while we work on moving it upstream.

If it ends up becoming clear that upstreaming won't happen for some subsystem, it should be moved out of this directory to somewhere non-internal.
